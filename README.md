Classification Workflow for Converged Infrastructure Systems

Project to provide consumers of Converged Infrastructure a way to classify their purchase into a standard category. Using the document "Market Share Analysis: Data Center Hardware Integrated Systems, 1Q11-2Q12" as a core reference (http://www.gartner.com/id=2260715 or http://www.vce.com/asset/documents/gartner-market-share-analysis-report.pdf), and extending the definitions to include the "hyper-converged infrastructure system" category, the goal would be for customers to easily classify a purchase into the category it belongs to, alleviating any confusion.

+ Integrated infrastructure systems — Server, shared-storage and network hardware integrated to provide shared compute infrastructure

+ Integrated workload systems — Integrated infrastructure systems that are pre-integrated with database and/or application software to provide appliance, or appliance-like, functionality

+ Integrated reference architectures — Products in which predefined, pre-sized components are designated as options for an integrated system, whereby the user and/or channel can make configuration choices between the predefined options

+ Hyper-converged infrastructure systems — Node-based, “abstract everything”, scale out infrastructure systems that tightly converge storage and compute pools presented to an upstream hypervisor

The general workflow is to start with a proposal for a converged infrastructure product from any vendor, work through the questions and arrive at a classification.
